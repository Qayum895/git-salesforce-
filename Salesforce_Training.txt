Lets Understand the Apex Coding (Sample Apex Class)
We will create a New Feature branch from the base branch (git branch branchname)
We have to checkout/Swtich into new created branch (git checkout)
We will create one apex class and add some Code Changes
Save the file
We have to add the changes from working area to staging area (git add .)
We have to see the status of current changes with (git Status)
We have to commit the staging area changes (git commit -m "message")
We have to see the status of current changes with (git Status)
We have to push the changes to gitHub Browser (git push) or For New branch we have to publish the branch by using the command like (git push --set-estreem origin branchname)
Once our changes are pushed into GitHub Browser then Raise PR (Pull Request).
Once PR is approved from our Dev team lead then the changes are going to merge into the Base Branch.
